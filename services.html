            <span class="resort">Turner Clean Auto Detailing</span> At Turner Clean Auto Detailing, every 
            detail matters. From the sparkle of your paint to the freshness of your interior, my work is 
            meticulous and filled with care. But while my detailing is thorough, I believe the process 
            should be simple and straightforward for you. Scheduling your service is easy — clear options, 
            transparent pricing, and no confusion — so you can enjoy a perfectly detailed car without any 
            hassle.
