        <h2>Knowing oneself is the beggining of all things</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="resort">About me, your detailer!</span> I grew up with parents who were extremely 
            clean and organized. I watched how much they appreciated their belongings and the care they put 
            into maintaining them. At first, I didn’t really care — like most of us, I groaned when asked to
             make my bed or clean my room. But over time, I began to enjoy it. Making my bed each morning, 
             keeping my things organized and dusted, started to bring me a real sense of calm and 
             accomplishment. Cleaning became something I loved. And when I got my first car, that I had purchased 
             with my own money, my passion for cleaning only grew!
            <br>
            <br>
            Not everyone feels this way, and not everyone has the time to care for their car like they’d 
            like. That’s where I come in — the yin to your yang. My goal is to give you the most pleasurable
             experience driving your car, so it feels as cared for as you’d want it to. When your car feels 
             great, you feel great.</p>
